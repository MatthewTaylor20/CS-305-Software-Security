# CS-305-Software-Security

Artemis Financial is a client that offers financial planning for their customers. They want to make sure that their public web interface is using the most current and effective software security. As I found security issues, I offered the appropriate advice for the company to fix the security as well as refactoring some of their code to include some of those security features. The security of the software a company uses is really important. It does a lot to build trust with customers, and especially in a world of finance, lacking security can ruin a business entirely. After refactoring some of the code, I made sure to rerun the Maven dependency check to see if I had introduced any new vulnerabilities. One of the things from this assignment that I might show future employers is the dependency checks that I ran and how I implemented cryptography with Keystore, and how I implemented the checksum. In addition, I would show the implementation of the server controller.
